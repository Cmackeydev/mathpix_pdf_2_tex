# mathpix_pdf_2_tex


## Hello World
This project permits to use the mathpix api in a more plug and play way (in my opinion).
It helps you convert a pdf to Latex or a every pdf in the current directory or a given directory

### Nota Bene
Im not a programming guru neither a python guru so the project is prone to error . Feel free to helps it to rise
